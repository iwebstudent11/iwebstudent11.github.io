                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <div class="date">07/12/2019</div>
                <p>This week I worked on UI design patterns. I added two custom UI designs to my webstie, that I made in
                    Adobe XD. I also made site headers and saw all the different headers that I can make. When I put the
                    UI designs on my webstie I used <a href="https://www.fancyapps.com/fancybox/3/">Fancy Box</a> to put
                    the UI desings in so that you could click on the UI design and look at it. I looked at different
                    site heros from different sites to see what they did. I also took pictures around Ioloni School to
                    use for my UI designs.</p>

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <div class="date">07/5/2019</div>
                <p>This week I made a prototype in Adobe XD. I made an About page and a Blog page in Adobe XD, by
                    duplicating my Home page. I changed the hero to say About and the text underneath About. I also
                    changed the lists in the About page. Then I made a Blog page and put my weekly blog posts in the
                    main content. I linked my Home page, About page, and Blog page to each other and shared my
                    prototype, by making a link. Then added the link to Visual Studio Code (VS Code).

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <div class="date">06/28/2019</div>
                <p>This week I tried out Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe XD. I made a logo that says
                    Summer 2019 and took a picture of it and modified it in Photoshop and Illustrator. Then in Adobe
                    Photoshop I played with a picture from Lorem Picsum and added filters to the picture to make it
                    look cool. In Adobe Illustrator I modified my summer 2019 logo that I drew. I made a customized
                    website with a picture for my background and changed the color of my header. </p>

                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <div class="date">06/21/2019</div>
                <p>This week I created sub pages I created my blog and about pages. I also styled my CSS by putting
                    color in the background and changed it red. I also changed my font and changed it to a different
                    color. I changed my backgrounds to different colors or styles. I used Termainal to make my sub pages
                    and styled my website. The three sub pages that I worked on were my home page, about page, and blog
                    page. The link to my three sub pages are: <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent11.github.io/index.html">Home</a>, <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent11.github.io/about.html">About</a>, and <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent11.github.io/blog.html">Blog</a>.</p>I used <a
                    hred="https://picsum.photos/">Lorem Picsum</a>
                for my backgrounds for my website. I designed my website and put some style in it.

                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <div class="date">06/14/2019</div>
                <p>My frist day of website fun! I learned how to create a live website that everyone could see. First I
                    logged in to <a href="https://creativemeadia.space">creativemeadia.space</a> and
                    started my course
                    for web design fun. Then I logged in to
                    Github.com where I made a repository. I used Terminal for the frist time to make my website. My
                    frist class was fun.</p>
